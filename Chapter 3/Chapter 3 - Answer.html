        <h2>Detailed Explanations</h2>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 1</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B (Using a code review process)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Logic bombs are code inserted into applications that execute under specific conditions. Code review processes can identify suspicious code, unauthorized functionality, or time-based triggers that characterize logic bombs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 2</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C (Pop-ups demanding a ransom)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Pop-ups demanding ransom payments are characteristic of ransomware, not rootkits. Rootkits are designed to remain hidden and provide backdoor access, not to extort money from users through visible ransom demands.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 3</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A (A keylogger)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A keylogger captures all keyboard input, including passwords when they are typed. This would allow a student to obtain the staff member's credentials without their knowledge.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 4</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A (Command and control)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> TCP port 6667 is the standard port for Internet Relay Chat (IRC), which is commonly used for command and control communications by malware.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 5</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D (A backdoor)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Software that allows remote access to systems is classified as a backdoor. The most precise classification for software providing unauthorized remote access is a backdoor.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 6</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A (Consuming resources)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Bloatware primarily impacts systems by consuming system resources (disk space, memory, CPU cycles) without providing benefit to users.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 7</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C (Spyware)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Spyware is specifically designed to gather information about users, including browsing habits and system information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 8</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D (Different vendors use different names for malware packages.)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Different antivirus vendors often use different naming conventions for the same malware. There is no standardized naming system.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 9</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D (Keyboard and other input from the user)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Software keyloggers capture keyboard input and may also capture other input such as mouse movements, touchscreen inputs, and credit card swipes.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 10</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C (Ransomware)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A message demanding payment in Bitcoin for encrypted files is the classic signature of ransomware.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 11</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B (Mount the drive on another system and scan it that way.)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Rootkits are designed to hide from detection by hooking into the operating system. Mounting the drive on a trusted, clean system prevents the rootkit from hiding its presence.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 12</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C (A logic bomb)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> A logic bomb is code that executes when specific conditions are met (in this case, the developer not being employed).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 13</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B (Wipe the drive and reinstall from known good media.)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The most reliable method is to wipe the drive completely and reinstall from known good media or restore from a clean backup.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 14</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B (How they spread)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> The key difference between worms and viruses is their propagation method. Worms spread themselves automatically without user interaction, while viruses require user action to spread.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 15</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B (Open the file using a text editor to review the code)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Python is an interpreted language with source code that can be read directly. Opening the Python file in a text editor allows direct examination of the code logic.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 16</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B (Preventing downloads from application stores)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Trojans are malware disguised as legitimate software that users voluntarily download and run. Preventing downloads from application stores directly addresses the primary infection vector for Trojans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 17</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C (A worm)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When malware exploits a network vulnerability to spread across multiple systems, this indicates worm behavior.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 18</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> D (Bloatware)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Unwanted programs pre-installed by manufacturers that load at startup are classic examples of bloatware.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 19</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> A (A bot)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Malware that connects to command and control systems for remote management are called bots. Multiple bots under centralized control form a botnet.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="definition-box">
            <h4>Question 20</h4>
            <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C (A trojan)</p>
            <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> When a user manually opens a file that appears innocent but contains malicious content, this is characteristic of a Trojan.</p>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 1</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: C. Threat hunting</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> Threat hunting assumes that an organization has already been compromised (presumption of compromise) and actively searches for evidence of successful attacks. It uses the attacker mindset to identify what attackers might do and what evidence they might leave behind.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
                <strong>A. Vulnerability scanning</strong> - Identifies potential vulnerabilities, doesn't assume compromise<br>
                <strong>B. Penetration testing</strong> - Tests security controls by attempting to exploit vulnerabilities<br>
                <strong>D. War driving</strong> - Reconnaissance technique for identifying wireless networks
            </div>
            <div class="concept-review">
                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Threat hunting builds on intelligence fusion, using threat feeds, advisories, and bulletins to search for indicators of compromise.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 2</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: D. Read-only</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> Credentialed scans should use read-only accounts following the principle of least privilege. Since credentialed scans typically only retrieve information and don't make changes to servers, read-only access is sufficient and reduces security risk.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
                <strong>A. Domain administrator</strong> - Excessive privileges, violates least privilege principle<br>
                <strong>B. Local administrator</strong> - More privileges than necessary for scanning<br>
                <strong>C. Root</strong> - Highest privilege level, unnecessary and risky for scanning
            </div>
            <div class="concept-review">
                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Credentialed scanning improves accuracy by accessing system configuration information while maintaining security through least privilege.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 3</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: C. Run the scan in a test environment</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> Dangerous (intrusive) plug-ins may disrupt production systems or damage content. Best practice is to test these plug-ins in a test environment first to identify potential issues before running on production systems.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
                <strong>A. Run against production</strong> - Risk of business disruption<br>
                <strong>B. Run during business hours</strong> - Maximizes potential impact if problems occur<br>
                <strong>D. Do not run the scan</strong> - Misses potential vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit
            </div>
            <div class="concept-review">
                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Intrusive plug-ins can cause system instability, so test environments provide safe testing grounds for dangerous scans.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 4</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: C. Low</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> In CVSS, the Attack Complexity (AC) metric has two values: Low (L) indicates the attack does not require specialized conditions and is simpler to exploit, while High (H) indicates specialized conditions are required.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
                <strong>A. High</strong> - Indicates more difficult exploitation requiring specialized conditions<br>
                <strong>B. Medium</strong> - Not a valid CVSS Attack Complexity value<br>
                <strong>D. Severe</strong> - Not a valid CVSS Attack Complexity value
            </div>
            <div class="concept-review">
                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> CVSS Attack Complexity only has two values: Low (easier) and High (harder).
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 5</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: A. False positive</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> A false positive occurs when a scanner reports a vulnerability that does not actually exist. In this case, the scanner reported a vulnerability on a system that was already properly patched.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
                <strong>B. False negative</strong> - When scanner misses an actual vulnerability<br>
                <strong>C. True positive</strong> - Correctly identifies an existing vulnerability<br>
                <strong>D. True negative</strong> - Correctly reports no vulnerability exists
            </div>
            <div class="concept-review">
                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> False positives require time-consuming administrator investigation and can be reduced through proper scanner configuration and credentialed scanning.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 6</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: B. Integrity</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> SQL injection allowing students to alter grades is an integrity attack. The CIA triad includes Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Preventing unauthorized data modification requires integrity controls.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
                <strong>A. Confidentiality</strong> - Protects against unauthorized disclosure, not modification<br>
                <strong>C. Alteration</strong> - Not a standard security control category<br>
                <strong>D. Availability</strong> - Protects against service disruption, not data modification
            </div>
            <div class="concept-review">
                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Integrity controls prevent unauthorized modification of data and include input validation, access controls, and database constraints.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 7</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: C. Metasploit</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> Metasploit is an exploitation framework used for actively exploiting vulnerabilities, not for reconnaissance. It's used after vulnerabilities are identified to test if they can be exploited.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
                <strong>A. Nmap</strong> - Port scanning tool commonly used in reconnaissance<br>
                <strong>B. Nessus</strong> - Vulnerability scanner used to identify weaknesses<br>
                <strong>D. Nslookup</strong> - DNS lookup tool for gathering domain information
            </div>
            <div class="concept-review">
                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Reconnaissance focuses on information gathering, while exploitation tools like Metasploit are used after vulnerabilities are identified.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 8</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: A. Patch management</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> The vulnerability description specifically mentions Microsoft Advisory MS17-010 and references patches to fix the SMB vulnerabilities. This is clearly a patch management issue where proper patching would have prevented the vulnerability.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
                <strong>B. File integrity monitoring</strong> - Monitors file changes, doesn't prevent vulnerabilities<br>
                <strong>C. Intrusion detection</strong> - Detects attacks, doesn't prevent vulnerabilities<br>
                <strong>D. Threat hunting</strong> - Searches for existing compromises, doesn't prevent vulnerabilities
            </div>
            <div class="concept-review">
                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Patch management is a fundamental security control that addresses known vulnerabilities by applying vendor-provided fixes.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 9</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: B. Web application vulnerability scanner</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a web-specific vulnerability that is best detected by specialized web application vulnerability scanners designed to test for web application flaws like XSS, SQL injection, and CSRF.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
                <strong>A. Static application test</strong> - May detect some XSS but less effective than web scanners<br>
                <strong>C. Intrusion detection system</strong> - Detects active attacks, not vulnerabilities<br>
                <strong>D. Network vulnerability scanner</strong> - Focuses on infrastructure, not web application flaws
            </div>
            <div class="concept-review">
                <strong>Key Concept:</strong> Web application scanners are specialized tools that test for web-specific vulnerabilities through dynamic testing and fuzzing.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="answer-item">
            <div class="question-number">Question 10</div>
            <div class="correct-answer">Correct Answer: A. Lateral movement</div>
            <div class="explanation">
                <strong>Explanation:</strong> Lateral movement (also called pivoting) occurs when an attacker uses a compromised system to gain access to other systems on the same network. Deploying a toolkit to access additional systems is a classic example of lateral movement.
            </div>
            <div class="why-wrong">
                <strong>Why other answers are incorrect:</strong><br>
